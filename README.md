# Fog Alert System IoT Project

There are many weather related car accidents. (https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/weather/q1_roadimpact.htm). In order to reduce the number of fog/icyroad accidents, one of the methods will be detecting and realtime updating the fog and icy,  and then setting alert in advcance for drivers.

This project is a prototype which is able to detect fog and icy. The best advatage of this system is to set per location under very low cost. The realtime infromation will also be intergeated with platform of self-driving system.
